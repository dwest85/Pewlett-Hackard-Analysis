# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
* The purpose of this sql analysis was to prepare our company for the inevitable "silver tsunami" employee retirement wave. The employee data was filtered through using queries to give strong insight into our future hiring wave plan and direction.

# Results
* First, we had to pull all of the data from our employees and titles databases to ensure all staff members were accounted for before we began the process of finding our "silver tsunami" employees.

* We needed to filter our data to provide only unique titles based on the most recent title by date. As many of our staff members have been promoted through the years, carrying several different titles, only the titles currently held provide the necessary data for replacement.

* A count of these employees needed to be filtered into their respected titles to give the human resources team some insight and direction with their future hiring plan.

* After providing our hiring team with the sound information to ensure our company didn't "skip a beat". We then used a query to determine which of these employees were eligible for our mentorship program.

# Summary
* How many roles do we need to fill throughout the span oof the "silver tsunami"?
* - After filtering our employee and title database for the current titles held by employees within the retirement range. It has been concluded that an estimated 90398 roles will need to be filled. A breakdown of those estimates by title are shown below.

* Based on the count from the mentorship eligibility table, there are only 1549 employees that meet the requirements of mentorship. This only makes up an estimated 2% of the work force that is elible for retirement, which is very low.
